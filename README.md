In the hartal problem we have to display the number of working days lost.We are given the h[j] set which is basically the interval at which the jth party calls for a strike. For example if a party's hartal paramater is 3 it will call for a strike every 3rd day, like on day 3,6,9,12...and so on uptil N. Now it is given that the party do nat call for strike on friday and saturday but the hartal parameter may fall on these days like in above example day 6 is a strike but it is friday(as our day 1 is sunday) so for the sake of simplicity we will consider these as non working days and skip them if encountered. Now another problem may be if multiple party are conducting strike on simultaneous day . In that case we will ignore checking all means if we see that if a party is conducting strike on a working day we will not check anyfurther and increase the count of working days lost as a result of strike.
