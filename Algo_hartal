1.Input t
2.For every test case t input N and P.
3.Another P inputs are taken.(hartal parameter of each party)
4.Set days_off=0.
5.A loop is run from i=1 to N
6.In the loop set ct=0.
7.Another loop is run within the previous which will run 
from j=0 to P
8.Check if i%h[j] equals 0.If the condition satisfied raise ct to 1 else go to next iteration.
9.outside of j loop check whether ct not equals 0, if yes raise the days_off by 1.
10.Check if i%7 equals 5 ,if yes perform i=i+2
11.Outside of the i loop print the days_off.
